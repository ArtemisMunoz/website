Welcome to Campfire Stories! Find a comfy spot and join us around the fire.

Campfire Stories is a livestreamed monthly open mic created by Artemis Munoz.
It’s a place for queer and trans people to explore and express themselves, in
a loving and welcoming space curated by an all-trans team. Each livestream
features community contributions, prize giveaways, and a moderated community
chat, all presented live within a secure and private platform.

Next Campfire Stories:
**17th June 2020**.
[Book now!](https://www.trybooking.com/book/event?eid=629561)

Campfire Stories evolved out of the Trans Pride Livestreamed Solidarity Cabaret
on 31 March 2020 by Artemis Munoz and Teddy Darling. It is part of SPARK,
a Transgender Victoria and Victorian Government initiative, and is supported by
a Sydney Gay & Lesbian Mardi Gras / ANZ Grant. 

Our goals are to build kinship and collective resilience through
self-expression and accessible community entertainment.

**Gemini** is a Hobart-based whirlwind of musical theatre, circus, cabaret,
burlesque, and the tip-shop. They are the torn stockings of bohemia, the
smeared lipstick of elegance, and the glint of a VB can in the gutter on
a starry night. Find them screaming into the void on Facebook, and Instagram.

## FAQs

**Where can I get the link for the livestream?**

Once you have booked via [Trybooking](https://www.trybooking.com/book/event?eid=629561) we will
email you the livestream link on 15 June! To make the stream as secure as
possible, we require everyone to register for the livestream, and we will send
out registration details with the livestream link.


**Can people under 18 participate?**

We recommend that attendees and participants be 16 years or over as we do not
attempt to curate or moderate the stories in the open mic. As such, there is
likely to be adult or explicit content as we encourage people to tell honest
stories and convey their experiences.

However, we also know that it is important for young queer and trans people to
be part of adult spaces and connect to mature stories in order to understand
themselves. As such, we recommend seeking parental permission, or watching with
the support of friends or mentors. Feel free to reach out if you need help, or
would like to ask us about our content.


**Can I watch previous shows?**

All of our previous shows, including the Trans Pride Livestreamed Solidarity
Cabaret are online as Youtube Playlists, over on the Artemis Munoz Youtube
Channel.


**How can I participate as a performer?**

If you identify within the umbrella of queer/LGBTQIA+, and have something to
express, we would love to have you! All you need to do is make a 3-5 minute
video and send it in to us.

We have prepared an information sheet about how to make a video which you can
download here PDF, TEXT


**Does my video have to be a story?**

We call all of our videos “stories”, but they can be any medium and expressed
in any way you like. You could read your own poetry, or talk about something
that happened in your life, or play music, or show us something without any
words.

If you need help, or would like to check if something is suitable, please feel
free to drop us a line - we’re here to help!


**Do I have to use my legal name?**

How you would like to represent yourself online is up to you! We need all
attendees to register for an account so that we can keep the space safe during
the livestream, but the name you choose for your account is totally up to you.
We will never make your email address or other contact details public.

Anyone wishing to submit a video to the open mic can also choose any name.


**When does the livestream start?**

The livestream starts on the 1st of every month, starting 1 July 2020. The stream starts at 7:30PM AEST, but the online space will be active from 7:15PM AEST if you want to log in early and get settled. 


**Is this just for queer / LGBTQIA+ people?**

Anyone in or supportive of queer communities can book a ticket and join us by
the fire. You are welcome in this space regardless of your identity as long as
you can respect our values and show support to our performers.

However, we ask that all performers in the open mic (sending in a performance
video) identify as trans/gender diverse/LGBTQIA+/queer.
