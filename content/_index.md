## Artemis Munoz
### Creator ♦ Storyteller ♦ Activist

Hello! I am Artemis Munoz, a maker of things and a teller of stories.

I strongly believe that art cannot be separated from politics and that the
limits of imagination should not be confined to the naturalistic or realistic.
You can find me my their lived experience as a queer, neurodivergent and
bi-racial person in creative ways or mentioning potatoes way more than any
human being should.

I work and live on the lands of the Wurundjeri people of the Kulin Nations.
Sovereignty was never ceded. I pay respect to Elders past, present & emerging.
Always was, always will be Aboriginal land.
